My GitHub account was created for labs and assignments for my classes at Wake Tech.

The repository I created is for files and projects that will be assigned later in my class.
 
In order to clone this repository I had to download the GitHub desktop application and then create an empty file on my hard drive within my Wake Tech folders to have a place to store the cloned repository.
